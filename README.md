# Automation Practice with Playwright

This project is an automation practice using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- Playwright

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/JavierAnalystQA/automation-practice-playwright.git

2. Install NPM packages

npm install

## Usage

You can run your test by using the "npx playwright test" command in your terminal. This will run all tests in your project.

After the tests have run, you can view the results in your terminal. If a test fails, Playwright will provide a detailed error message to help you diagnose the problem.

NOTE: You can also record a test using the command:  npx playwright codegen
